# Password-Generator

## Description

This application is intended to randomly generate a password for the user. The application allows the user to choose a combination on criteria such as: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numeric and special characters. 
The password generator was assigned with a pre-coded HTML file and my task was to write the JavaScript code to make the application actually generate a password.
Working on this project was a challenge and required me to stretch my understanding and research ability in JavaScript. It was extremely challanging but I'm taking away a much more broad understanding of function structure and JavaScript syntax and fundamentals.

## Usage

This application can be used by anyone wanting a randomly generated password of their chosen length and character preference. The interface and structure is easy to use and understand.

## Credits

While I didn't collaborate in writing the code for this application, I got a lot of help reading forums, stack overflow, MDN docs, W3 Schools and many other online resources. Also, as mentioned previously, this application was assigned with HTML and some basic JavaScript starter code.
